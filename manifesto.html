        <p>Many products claim they care are "privacy-friendly."
        <p>but, what does that mean to care about people's data and mind?</p>
        <p>here is a suggestive list of criterion:</p>
        <br/>
        <p>1) the code should be open-source. Why shall people trust teams of products who don't trust to open source their code?</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>2) there should be no trackers. Stop tracking people. People are not the product. Whether people pay for the product is irrelevant. People should not be subject to the product. People should not be subject to tracking. Can product teams trust their vision to lead product development with no tracking?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>3) venture-capital-backed product - who knows how venture-capital-backed products will exit. which companies will end up buying out those products/startups? where will people's data end up?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>4) is the infrastructure of your product centralised or decentralised? do you process people's data on servers? we favour product that works in a decentralised manner, locally.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>5) no scroll.</p>
